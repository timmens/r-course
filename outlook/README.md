# Outlook to 'Introduction to R' class (2019) 

In this small outlook I will present a modern (*computer science*) approach to data analysis using contemporary software. 

We will go through some new (but relevant) software packages build for R by analyzing a case study. Namely, we will study the established iris data set utilizing 

- tidyverse packages 
- ggplot2 (technically a subpackage of tidyverse) -for data plotting
- e1071 (support vector machine) - machine learning
- randomForest -machine learning 
- nnet - machine learning

and writing everything in a beautiful R Markdown document. 

## For playing with the project (follow these steps)

1. have all files in the same directory and adjust the directory path in the .rmd file
2. open the .rmd file in RStudio 
3. let RStudio compile the file
